# Employee Reimbursement System

## Project Description
For Project 1, I developed an employee expense reimbursement system based upon the guidelines given. This was a full stack application showcasing both front and back end capabilities. In this project, I used a variety of technologies and languages to achieve the requirements. An employee with specific login information can create an expense request including details about the desire for reimbursement. Then, a manager logs in with their own credentials and either accepts or denies the request. Both employee and manager is able to view past and pending requests, which will be updated upon the managere's decision. 

## Technologies Used
  * Java - version 1.8
  * Javalin - version 4.3.0
  * JUnit - version 5.8.2
  * Cucumber - version 7.2.3
  * Selenium - version 4.1.1
  * Mockito - version 4.4.0
  * PostgreSQL - version 42.3.1
